SPARCSIM leaves ample scope for further improvement. A few of 
the possible value additions are listed below: 

 # *Implementation of unsupported commands:* SPARCSIM implements a large subset of SPARC v8 ISA. 
 # *Support for synthetic instructions:* Presently simulator’s internal disassembler can disassemble the instructions to their non-synthetic equivalent. It can further be augmented with an ability to decode the assembly opcodes to their synthetic mnemonic. 
 # *Reading symbol table:* Symbol table of ELF binary is discarded. That can be read to produce much more developer-friendly disassembled output by substituting HEX coded memory addresses by corresponding symbol names. 
 # *Support for Peripherals:* Add-on modules can be made to support by the simulator to emulate processor peripherals and timer. 
 # *Implementation of pipelining:* The simulator can be made clock cycle aware so that pipelining can be implemented to visualize processor’s performance at clock level instead of instruction level.
 # *Implementation of cache:* The simulator can be made to support cache memory to enable generation of statistical data about cache hit and miss.
